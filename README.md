CHATBOT WITH RAG + VOICE FEATURES,app link below

https://chatbot1py-hzjg4oywxgcpr59vxvc3bg.streamlit.app/

In this I added voice features,chat history,can answer questions which are not related to context by saying : 
Answering in general as context is not provided

For the basic frontend picture of the website I directly used streamlit chatbot model and built on it

For basic chatbot structure I took inspiration from a yt channel and then made improvements using ChatGPT and Deepseek

I learnt adding voice features from chatgpt and deepseek, had a lot of troubles fixing it.

I actually learnt more about environments in python and more regarding API keys.

It took me a lot of time to make add voice features and far as the basic RAG model as I already had to make a similar project related to cynaptics club,
It was easy for me to complete the basic one.
I had troubles working with ffmpeg and also my app had exceeded data limit as I accidentally saved all the vectors in single directory and it did'nt reset after the session logout,then I had to use a temporary uuid and make it accessible.

I named it dumbo cause I felt dumb when I was using similar websites on internet for my exam prep and this was a model,which I could make on my own,It felt good as it was the 1st project that I made that had some sort of usage to a student's life.
